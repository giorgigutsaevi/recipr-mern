# RECIPR APP - MERN

# About the Project
This is my Recipe app that allows users to store their favourite recipes.\
This app is created entirely with a MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js for the backend.

## Project Overview
- Visiting users can sign up, log in and log out. 
- All routes are protected with middleware, so unregistered users can't view recipes
- Authorized or logged in users generate a JWT token. The token is then stored as a httpOnly cookie and preserved throughout the app, as long as the user is NOT logged out. 
- Authorized users can then perform CRUD operations with the recipe. Meaning, they can create, read, update and delete recipes.

### Dashboard

#### Dashboard displays the following components:
##### Navbar Component 
- navbar conditionally renders elements whether the user is **signed in** or **logged out**. This is achieved by creating a Context that maintains the user's authorization state throughout the app (a boolean value).
##### Welcome Component 
- Displays the greeting, depending on the time of the day -> I used a useTime custom hook to calculate what time of the day it is.
- Username - Once the user signs up or logs in, a JWT token is created which carries user's email, unique MongoDB _id and the username. I also created UserContext that retrieves the unique JWT token, decodes user's information and that information is then rendered out.
- Current date -> Using the useTime custom hook
- Current time -> Using the useTime custom hook
- Current temperature in celcius -> With express, I set up a simple axios call on the Openweathermap.com API, that gives me the current temperature for London
##### RecipeList component
- The app will render a custom message if there are no recipes yet.

### Login Page
