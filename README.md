# RECIPR APP - MERN

# About the Project
This is my Recipe app that allows users to store their favourite recipes.\
This app is created entirely with a MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js for the backend. \

## Project Overview
- Visiting users can sign up, log in and log out. 
- All routes are protected with middleware, so unregistered users can't view recipes
- Authorized or logged in users generate a JWT token. The token is then stored as a httpOnly cookie and preserved throughout the app, as long as the user is NOT logged out. 
- Authorized users can then perform CRUD operations with the recipe. Meaning, they can create, read, update and delete recipes.
